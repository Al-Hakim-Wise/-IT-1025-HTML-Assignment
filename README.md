# IT-1025 HTML Assignment â€“ Cybersecurity Web Page

This project is part of my IT-1025 course at Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C).  
It is a basic HTML webpage that I created using W3Schools to demonstrate understanding of fundamental HTML tags.

## Theme: Cybersecurity Awareness

### What it Includes:
- Two headings
- A paragraph about cybersecurity
- A hyperlink to CISA.gov
- An unordered list of online safety tips

### Screenshot
The file `MyHTML.png` shows both the HTML code and the output in the browser.
